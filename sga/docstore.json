Sale and agreement to sell. \u2014(1) A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller \ntransfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a price. There may be a contract of \nsale between one part -owner and another.  \n(2) A contract of sale may be absolute or condit ional.  \n(3) Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer, \nthe contract is called a sale, but where the transfer of the property in the goods is to take place at a future \ntime or subject to some conditi on thereafter to be fulfilled, the contract is called an agreement to sell.  \n(4) An agreement to, sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled subject \nto which the property in the goods is to be transferred.  \nFormalities of the contract  \n5. Contract of sale how made. \u2014(1) A contract of sale is made by an offer to buy or sell goods for a \nprice and the acceptance of such offer. The contract may provide for the immediate delivery of the goods \nor immediate payment of the price or both,  or for the delivery or payment by instalments, or that the \ndelivery or payment or both shall be postponed.  \n(2) Subject to the provisions of any law for the time being in force, a contract of sale may be made in \nwriting or by word of mouth, or partly in wr iting and partly by word of mouth or may be implied from the \nconduct of the parties.  \nSubject -matter of contract  \n6. Existing or future goods. \u2014(1) The goods which form the subject of a contract  of sale may be \neither existing goods, owned or possessed by the seller, or future goods.  \n(2) There may be a contract for the sale of goods the acquisition of which by the seller depends upon \na contingency which may or may not happen.  \n(3) Where by a contract of sale the seller purports to effect a present sale of future  goods, the contract \noperates as an agreement to sell the goods.  \n7. Goods perishing before making of contract.   \u2014 Where there is a contract for the sale of specific \ngoods, the contract is void if the goods without the knowledge of the seller have, at the  time when the \ncontract was made, perished or become so damaged as no longer to answer to their description in the \ncontract.  \n8. Goods perishing before sale but after agreement to sell .\u2014Where there is an agreement to sell \nspecific goods, and subsequently the goods without any fault on the part of the seller or buyer perish or \nbecome so damaged as no longer to answer to their description in the agreement before the risk passes to \nthe buyer, the agreement is thereby avoided.", "start_char_idx": null,

\n9.Ascertainment of price.\u2014(1) The price in a contract of sale may be fixed by the contract or may \nbe left to be fixed in manner thereby agreed or may be determined by the course of dealing between the \nparties.(2) Where the price is not determined in accorda nce with the foregoing provisions, the buyer shall \npay the seller a reasonable price.What is a reasonable price is a question

of the contract.12.Condition and warranty.\u2014(1) A stipulation in a contract of sale with reference to goods which \nare the subject thereof may be a condition or a warranty.(2) A cond ition is a stipulation essential to the main purpose of the contract, the breach of which \ngives rise to a right to treat the contract as repudiated.(3) A warranty is a stipulation collateral to the main purpose of the contract, the breach of which \ngives r ise to a claim for damages but not to a right to reject the goods and treat the contract as repudiated.(4) Whether a stipulation in a contract of

delivery of the goods, \nor both, is postponed.21.Specific goods to be put into a deliverable state.\u2014Where there is a contract for the sale of \nspecific goods and the seller is bound to do something to the goods for the purpose of putting  them into a \ndeliverable state, the property does not pass until such thing is done and the buyer has notice thereof.22.Specific goods in a deliverable state, when the seller has to do anything thereto in order to \nascertain price.\u2014Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, but the \nseller is bound to weigh, measure, test or do some other act or thing with reference to the goods for the \npurpose of ascertaining the price, the property does not pass until such act o r thing is done and the buyer \nhas notice thereof.23.Sale of unascertained goods and appropriation.\u2014(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of \nunascertained or future goods by description and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are \nunconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the \nbuyer with the assent of the seller, the

the \nseller to send them to the buyer is a question depending in each case on the contract, express or implied, \nbetween the parties.Apart from any such contract, goods sold are to be delivered at the place at which \nthey are at the time of the sale, and goods agreed to be sold are to be delivered at the place at whic h they \nare at the time of the agreement to sell, or, if not then in existence, at the place at which they are \nmanufactured or produced.(2) Where under the contract of sale the seller is bound to send the goods to the buyer, but no time \nfor sending them is fixed, the seller is bound to send them within a reasonable time.(3) Where the goods at the time of sale are in the possession of a third person, there is no delivery by \nseller to buyer unless and until such third person acknowledges to the buyer that  he holds the goods on his \nbehalf:  \nProvided that nothing in this section shall affect the operation of the issue or transfer of any document \nof

of and incidental to putting the goods into a deliverable \nstate shall be borne by the seller.37.Delivery of wrong quantity.\u2014(1) Where the seller delivers to the b uyer a quantity of goods less \nthan he contracted to sell, the buyer may reject them, but it the buyer accepts the goods so delivered he \nshall pay for them at the contract rate.(2) Where the seller delivers to the buyer a quantity of goods larger than he c ontracted to sell, the \nbuyer may accept the goods included in the contract and reject the rest, or he may reject the whole.If the \nbuyer accepts the whole of the goods so delivered, he shall pay for them at the contract rate.(3) Where the seller delivers to the buyer the goods he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a \ndifferent description not included in the contract, the buyer may accept the goods which are in accordance \nwith the contract and reject the rest, or may reject the whole.(4) The provisions  of this section are subject to any usage of trade, special agreement or course of \ndealing between the parties.38.Instalment deliveries.\u2014(1) Unless otherwise agreed, the buyer of goods is not bound to accept \ndelivery thereof by instalments.(2) Where the re is a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered by stated instalments which are to \nbe separately paid for, and the seller makes no delivery or defective delivery in respect of one or more \ninstalments, or the buyer neglects or refuses to take deliver y of or pay for one or more instalments, it is a \nquestion in each case depending on the terms of the contract

Buyer not bound to return rejected goods. \u2014Unless otherwise agreed, where goods are \ndelivered to the buyer and he refuses to accept them, having the right so to do, he is not bound to return \nthem to the seller, but it is sufficient if he intimate s to the seller that he refuses to accept them.  \n44. Liability of buyer for neglecting or refusing delivery of goods. \u2014When the seller is ready and \nwilling to deliver the goods and requests the buyer to take delivery, and the buyer does not within a \nreasonab le time after such request take delivery of the goods, he is liable to the seller for any loss \noccasioned by his neglect or refusal to take delivery, and also for a reasonable charge for the care and \ncustody of the goods:  \nProvided that nothing in this sect ion shall affect the rights of the seller where the neglect or refusal of \nthe buyer to take delivery amounts to a repudiation of the contract.  \nCHAPTER V  \nRIGHTS OF UNPAID SELLER AGAINST THE GOODS  \n45. \u201cUnpaid seller\u201d defined. \u2014(1) The seller of goods is deeme d to be an \u201cunpaid seller\u201d within the \nmeaning of this Act \u2014  \n(a) when the whole of the price has not been paid or tendered;  \n(b) when a bill of exchange or other negotiable instrument has been received as conditional \npayment, and the condition on which it wa s received has not been fulfilled by reason of the dishonour \nof the instrument or otherwise.  \n(2) In this Chapter, the term \u201cseller\u201d includes any person who is in the position of a seller, as, for \ninstance, an agent of the seller to whom the bill of lading has been endorsed, or a consignor or agent who \nhas himself paid, or is directly responsible for, the price.  \n46.

buyer or his \nagent in that behalf takes delivery of them from such carrier or other bailee.  \n(2) If the buyer or his agent in that behalf obtains delivery of the goods before their arrival at the \nappointed destination, the transit is a t an end.  \n(3) If, after the arrival of the goods at the appointed destination, the carrier or other bailee \nacknowledges to the buyer or his agent that he holds the goods on his behalf and continues in possession \nof them as bailee for the buyer or his agent , the transit is at an end and it is immaterial that a further \ndestination for the goods may have been indicated by the buyer.  \n(4) If the goods are rejected by the buyer and the carrier or other bailee  continues in possession of \nthem, the transit is not deemed to be at an end, even if the seller has refused to receive them back.  \n(5) When goods are delivered to a ship chartered by the buyer, it is a question depending on the \ncircumstances of the particul ar case, whether they are in the possession of the master as a carrier or as \nagent of the buyer.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template":

that behalf, the transit is deemed to be at an end.(7) Where part delivery of the goods has been made to the buyer or his agent in that behalf, the \nremainder of the goods may be stopped in transit, unless such part delivery has been given in such \ncircumstances as to show an agreement to give up possession of the whole of the goods.52.How stoppage in transit is effected.\u2014(1) The unpaid sellermay exercise his right of stoppage in \ntransit either by taking actual possession of the goods, or by giving notice of his claim to the carrier or \nother bailee  in whose possession the goods are.Such notice may be given either to the person in actual \npossession of the goods or to his principal.In the latter case the notice, to be effectual, shall be given at \nsuch time and in such circumstances that the principa l, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, may \ncommunicate it to his servant or agent in time to prevent a delivery to the buyer.(2) When notice of stoppage in transit is given by the seller to the carrier or other bailee in possession \nof the goods, he s hall re -deliver the goods to, or according to the directions of, the seller.The expenses of \nsuch re -delivery shall be borne by the seller.Transfer by buyer and seller  \n53.Effect of sub -sale or pledge by buyer.\u2014(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, t he unpaid \nseller \u2019s right of lien or stoppage in transit is not affected by any sale or other disposition of the goods \nwhich the buyer may have made, unless the seller has assented thereto:  \nProvided that where a document of title to goods has been issued or  lawfully transferred to any person \nas buyer or owner of the goods, and that person transfers the document to a person who takes the \ndocument in good faith and for consideration, then, if such last mentioned transfer was by way a sale, the \nunpaid seller \u2019s right of lien or stoppage in transit is defeated, and, if such last mentioned transfer was by \nway of pledge or other disposition for value, the unpaid seller \u2019s right of lien or stoppage is transit can \nonly be exercised subject to the rights of the transfer ee.(2) Where the transfer is by way of pledge, the unpaid seller may require the pledgee to have the \namount secured by the pledge satisfied in the first instance, as far as possible, out of any other goods or \nsecurities of the buyer in the hands of the pl edgee and available against the buyer  \n54.Sale not generally rescinded by lien or stoppage in transit.\u2014(1) Subject to the provisions of \nthis section, a contract of sale is not rescinded by the mere exercise by an unpaid seller of his right of lien \nor stopp age in transit.(2) Where the goods are of a perishable nature, or where the unpaid seller who has exercised his right \nof lien or stoppage in transit gives notice to the buyer of his intention to re -sell, the unpaid seller may, if \nthe buyer does not within  a reasonable time pay or tender the price, re -sell the goods within a reasonable \ntime and recover from the original buyer damages for any loss occasioned by his breach of contract, but \nthe buyer shall not be entitled to any profit which may occur on the r e-sale.If such notice is not given, the \nunpaid seller shall not be entitled to recover such damages and the buyer shall be entitled to the profit, if \nany, on the re -sale.(3) Where an unpaid seller who has exercised his right of lien or stoppage in transi t re-sells the goods, \nthe buyer acquires a good title thereto as against the original buyer, notwithstanding that no notice of the            \nre-sale has been given to the original buyer.(4) Where the seller expressly reserves a right of re -sale in case t he buyer should make default, and, \non the buyer making default, re -sells the goods, the original contract of sale is thereby rescinded, but \nwithout prejudice to any claim which the seller may have for damages.CHAPTER VI  \nSUITS
