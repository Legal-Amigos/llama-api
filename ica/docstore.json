positive assertion, in a manner not warranted by the information of the person making it, \nof that which is not true, t hough he believes it to be true;  \n(2) any breach of duty which, without an intent to deceive, gains an advantage to the person \ncommitting it,  or any one claiming under him; by misleading another to his prejudice , or to the \nprejudice  of any one claiming under him;  \n(3) causing, however innocently, a party to an agreement , to make a mistake as to the substance \nof the thing which i s the subject of the agreement.19.Voidability of a greements without free consent .\u2014When consent to an agreement is caused by \ncoercion,  1*** fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party \nwhose consent was so caused.A party to a contract whose cons ent was caused by fraud or mis representation, may, if he thinks fit, \ninsist that the contract shall b e performed, and that he shall be put in the position in which he would have \nbeen if the representations made had  been true.Exception .\u2014If such consent was caused by misrepresentation or by silence, fraudulent within the \nmeaning of section 17, the contract , nevertheless, is not voidable, if the party whose consent was so \ncaused had the means of discovering the truth with ordinary diligence.Explanation .\u2014A fraud or misrepresentation which did not cause the consent to a contract of the party \non whom such fraud was practised, or to whom such misrepresentation was made, does not render a \ncontract voidable.Illustrations  \n(a) A, intending to deceive B, falsely represents that five hundred maunds of indigo are made annually at A \u201fs factory, and \nthereby induces B to buy the factory.The contract is voidable at the option of B.(b) A, by a misrepresentation, leads B erroneously to believe that, five hundred maunds o f indigo are made annually at A \u201fs \nfactory.B examines the accounts of the factory, which show that only four hundred maunds of indigo have been made.After thi s \nB buys the factory.The contract is not voidable on account of A \u201fs misrepresentation.(c) A fraudulently informs B that A \u201fs estate is free from incumbrance.B thereupon buys the estate.The estate is subject to a \nmortgage.B may either avoid the contract, or may insist on its being carried out and the mortgage d ebt redeemed.(d) B, having discove red a vein of ore on the estate of A, adopts means to conceal, and does conceal, the existence of the ore \nfrom A.Through A \u201fs ignorance B is enabled to buy the estate at an under -value.The contract is voidable at the opt ion of A.(e) A is entitled to succ eed to an estate at the death of B , B dies: C, having received intelligence of B \u201fs death, preven ts the \nintelligence reaching A, and thus induces A to sell him his interest in the estate.The sale is voidable at the optio n of A.2[19A.Power to set aside co ntract induced by undue influence .\u2014When consent to an agreement is \ncaused by undue influence, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the par ty whose consent \nwas so caused.Any such contract may be set aside either absolutely or, if the party  who was entitled to avoid it has \nreceived any benefit thereunder, upon such terms and conditions  as to the Court may seem just.Illustrations  \n(a) A\u201fs son has forged B \u201fs name to a promissory note.B under threat of prosecuting A \u201fs son, obtains a bond from A for the \namount of the forged note.If B sues on this bond, the Court may set the bond

parties are under mistake as to  matter of fact .\u2014Where both the \nparties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the ag reement, the agreement \nis void.Explanation .\u2014An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject -matter of \nthe agreement , is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact.Illustrations  \n(a)

Right of person dealin g with agent personally liable .\u2014In cases where the agent is personally \nliable, a person dealing with him may hold either him or his prin cipal, or both of them, liable.  \nIllustration  \nA enters into a contract with B to sell him 100 bales of cotton, and afterwards discovers that B was acting as agent for C.

Person falsely contracting as age nt not entitled to performance .\u2014A person with whom a \ncontract has been entered into in the character of agent, is not entitled to require the performance of it, if \nhe was in reality acting, not as  agent, but on his own account.  \n237. Liability of principal induc ing belief that agent \u2019s unauthoriz ed acts were authorized .\u2014\nWhen an agent has, without authority, done acts or incurred obligations to  third persons on behalf of his \nprincipal, the principal is bound by such acts or obligations, if he has by his words or conduct induced \nsuch third persons to believe that such acts and obligations were within the scope of the agent \u201fs authority.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A consig ns goods to B for sale, and gives him instructions not to sell under a fixed price. C, being ignorant of B \u201fs \ninstructions, enters into a contract with B to buy the goods at a price lower than the reserved pri ce.
