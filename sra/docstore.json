Alternative prayer for rescission in suit for specific performance.\u2014 A plaintiff instituting a \nsuit for the specific performance of a contract in writing may pray in the alternative that, if the contract \ncannot be specifically enforced, it may be rescinded and delivered up to be cancelled; and the court, if it \nrefuses to enforce the contract specifically, may direct it to be rescinded and delivered up accordingly. \n30. Court may require parties rescinding to do equity.\u2014 On adjudging the rescission of a contract, \nthe court may require the party to whom such relief is granted to restore, so far as may be, any benefit \nwhich he may have received from the other party and to make any compensation to him which justice \nmay require. \nCHAPTER V \nCANCELLATION OF INSTRUMENTS \n31. When cancellation may be ordered.\u2014 (1) Any person against whom a written instrument is void \nor voidable, and who has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding may cause him \nserious injury, may sue to have it adjudged void or voidable; and the court may, in its discretion, so \nadjudge it and order it to be delivered up and cancelled. \n(2) If the instrument has been registered under the Indian Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908), the \ncourt shall also send a copy of its decree to the officer in whose office the instrument has been so \nregistered; and such officer shall note on the copy of the instrument contained in his books the fact of its \ncancellation. \n32. What instruments may be partially cancelled.\u2014 Where an instrument is evidence of different \nrights or different obligations, the court may, in a proper case, cancel it in part and allow it to stand for the \nresidue. \n33. Power to require benefit to be restored or compensation to be made when instrument is \ncancelled or is successfully resisted as being void or voidable.\u2014 (1) On adjudging the cancellation of \nan instrument, the court may require the party to whom such relief is granted, to restore, so far as may be \nany benefit which he may have received from the other party and to make any compensation to him which \njustice may require. \n(2) Where a defendant successfully resists any suit on the ground\u2014 \n(a) that the instrument sought to be enforced against him in the suit is voidable, the court may if \nthe defendant has received any benefit under the instrument from the other party, require him to \nrestore, so far as may be, such benefit to that party or to make compensation for it; \n(b) that the agreement sought to be enforced against him in the suit is void by reason of his not \nhaving been competent to contract under section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872), the \ncourt may, if the defendant has received any benefit under the agreement from the other party, require \nhim to restore, so far as may be, such benefit to that party, to the extent to which he or his estate has \nbenefited thereby .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e081f82-a1de-432f-8f1a-9db515a38502": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e081f82-a1de-432f-8f1a-9db515a38502", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "sra.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f433d1a6-5685-475d-9f6b-d8caaf5ea983", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "sra.pdf"}, "hash": "fd5a34d62b92af6b9d4b5fedea85d400d19ff36bd3c483f50948cbfe857dbb51"}}, "hash": "6384db0614b2204a7987871ed70ec9d1f5b83065ecd2b93f3a53d98b171b777c", "text": "14 CHAPTER VI \nDECLARATORY DECREES \n34.

Preventive relief how granted.\u2014 Preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the court by \ninjunction, temporary or perpetual. \n37.

Perpetual injunction when granted.\u2014 (1) Subject to the other provisions contained in or \nreferred to by this Chapter, a perpetual injunction may be granted to the plaintiff to prevent the breach of \nan obligation existing in his favour, whether expressly or by implication. \n(2) When any such obligation arises from contract, the court shall be guided by the rules and \nprovisions contained in Chapter II. \n(3) When the defendant invades or threatens to invade the plaintiff\u2019s right to, or enjoyment of, \nproperty, the court may grant a perpetual injunction in the following cases, namely:\u2014 \n(a) where the defendant is trustee of the property for the plaintiff; \n(b) where there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused, or likely to be \ncaused, by the invasion; \n(c) where the invasion is such that compensation in money would not afford adequate relief; \n(d) where the injunction is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial proceedings. \n39. Mandatory injunctions.\u2014 When, to prevent the breach of an obligation, it is necessary to compel \nthe performance of certain acts which the court is capable of enforcing, the court may in its discretion \ngrant an injunction to prevent the breach complained of, and also to compel performance of the requisite \nacts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f6a76d9-cd43-4d44-87b0-26d22f8b9de6": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f6a76d9-cd43-4d44-87b0-26d22f8b9de6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "sra.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "caf81001-04ac-4859-89c5-9b13cf88ca57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "sra.pdf"}, "hash": "46559b7de8b9b9ea8fb4008767a7581b058b453138c4ebedb2f6eebca90a9188"}}, "hash": "fa0bdb05f87de1cd8eba9e1c292804d462da9bb94b8742d3838e6b8c8142f007", "text": "15 40.
